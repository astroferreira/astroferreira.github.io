  <h2>About</h2>

  <p>I am a Visiting Professor at the Universidade Federal do Rio Grande (FURG) and Head Scientist at StarFruit. I am leading the creation of the Artificial Intelligence and Astrophysics (AIA) lab, an initiative funded by the Conhecimento Brasil grant and associated with FURG's Institute of Mathematics, Statistics, and Physics (IMEF).</p>

  <p>My research seeks to uncover how galaxies evolve across cosmic time, with a focus on the transformational impact of galaxy mergers. I combine large-scale cosmological simulations and deep learning with data from both ground and space-based telescopes to model the observational signatures of these mergers.</p>
  
  <p>Using JWST NIRCam imaging with the EPOCHS group, I demonstrated that massive galaxies at z>3 have more regular optical morphologies than previously thought. I also made key contributions to the EPOCHS internal JWST data reduction pipeline, which aims to standardize the processing of all public extragalactic data.</p>
  
  <p>More recently, during my postdoctoral fellowship at the University of Victoria, I joined the Ultraviolet Near Infrared Optical Northern Survey (UNIONS) collaboration. In this role, I created MUMMI, a ensemble of vision models tailored to identify and characterize galaxy mergers up to z~0.3, leveraging the survey's exquisite depth to reveal low-surface brightness features hidden in previous imaging.</p>

  <p>
    I was awarded a PhD degree from University of Nottingham

I'm also part of PEALRS and UVCANDELS. </p>

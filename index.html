  <h2>About</h2>

  <p>I am a Visiting Professor at the Universidade Federal do Rio Grande (FURG) and Head Scientist at StarFruit. I am
    leading the creation of the Artificial Intelligence and Astrophysics (AIA) lab, an initiative funded by the
    Conhecimento Brasil grant and associated with FURG's Institute of Mathematics, Statistics, and Physics (IMEF).</p>

  <p>My research seeks to uncover how galaxies evolve across cosmic time, with a focus on the transformational impact of
    galaxy mergers. I combine large-scale cosmological simulations and deep learning with data from both ground and
    space-based telescopes to model the observational signatures of these mergers.</p>

  <p>Using JWST NIRCam imaging with the EPOCHS group, I demonstrated that massive galaxies at z>3 have more regular
    optical morphologies than previously thought. I also made key contributions to the EPOCHS internal JWST data
    reduction pipeline, which aims to standardize the processing of all public extragalactic data.</p>

  <p>More recently, during my postdoctoral fellowship at the University of Victoria, I joined the Ultraviolet Near
    Infrared Optical Northern Survey (UNIONS) collaboration. In this role, I created MUMMI, a ensemble of vision models
    tailored to identify and characterize galaxy mergers up to z~0.3, leveraging the survey's exquisite depth to reveal
    low-surface brightness features hidden in previous imaging.</p>

  <p>
    I was awarded a PhD degree from University of Nottingham

        href="https://eprints.nottingham.ac.uk/73395/">(link)</a></span>, where I worked under supervision of Prof.
    Chris Conselice and Dr. Ulrike Kushner on the evolution of galaxy mergers at high redshift with HST and JWST. I'm
    also part of PEALRS and UVCANDELS.
